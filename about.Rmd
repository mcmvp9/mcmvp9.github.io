I am currently a Masters of Public Health student at the Mailman School of Public  Health studying Epidemiology with a certificate in Applied Biostatistics and Public Health Data Science. I am interested in Data Science, Programming and using statistics to inform evidence based decision making and research. I am originally from Liberia, West Africa but I moved to United States in 2015. I enjoy traveling, watching documentaries, and weight lifting during my free time.

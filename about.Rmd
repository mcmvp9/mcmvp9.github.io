<br>
I'm a Liberian-American living in Newark, New Jersey. I moved to the United States in 
2015 and spent the majority of my time living in Minneapolis, MN
before moving to New Jersey. 

I attended the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities and studied Biology, Society 
& Environment with a minor in Public Health. <br>My minor exposed me to the field of 
public health and this is where my journey begun. I engaged in numerous research and 
internship opportunities during the summers from my sophomore year up unitl I
graduated in 2020. My first professional <br> public health role
came after graduation, during the Covid-19 pandemic. I worked for the 
Minnesota Department of Health, <br> helping with the response efforts to the pandemic 
in the state of Minnesota. <br>

It was during this time that I became particulary fascinated with 
data, the collection processes via interviews and surveys and analysis. As a Data Deduplciation Lead,
I spent my work day examining Covid-19 data and ensuring accurate entries and organization
into the Minnesota Disease Surveillance System. <br> 
In 2021, I decided to pursue a Master of Public Health in Epidemiology, with a certificate in 
Applied Biostatistics and Public Health Data Science to develop the skills I would need to pursue 
a career working with all types of data. I am interested in Data Science, Programming and 
using statistics to inform evidence based decision making and research. 

During my free time, I enjoy traveling, watching documentaries, and weight lifting.
I am a huge soccer fan of Arsenal Football Club in London, UK and during the weekends 
you can catch me watching the games despite the time difference between the two countries.
